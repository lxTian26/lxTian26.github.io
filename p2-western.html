            An interactive storytelling game design based on the classic Chinese opera play The Western Chamber. By
            taking on the
            role of the Hong Niang, the player helps the couple, the scholar Zhang Sheng and the daughter of a nobleman,
            Cui Yingying, get through the obstacles and successfully settle their marriage.

          <h1 class="fw-light text-center text-black">Why this?</h1>
          <p class="lead text-black text-left" style="--bs-text-opacity: .6;">
            The original intention of this project is to make traditional Chinese art more accessible to young people.
            For me, the most attractive thing about operas is their stories and tunes. But a lot of my friends around me
            think opera is only for old people, or find it boring, they can't understand or feel the appeal of opera.
            Therefore, I want to bring my favourite and most engaging voice to a wider audience, and perhaps let more
            people understand the appeal of opera and reshape their understanding of opera.
          </p>
          <p class="lead text-black text-left" style="--bs-text-opacity: .6;">
            In addition, The Story of the Western Chamber was chosen as the prototype for the project due to its unique
            narrative style. In my opinion, love stories often appear in the tragic background of drama. But the Story
            of the Western Chamber is different in that its theme of tragic love and characters comes to a happy ending.
            The character who makes the story so successful is Cui Yingying's maid matchmaker, who helps Cui Yingying
            and Zhang Sheng throughout the story after seeing the old woman's immoral behaviour. Therefore, I decided to
            tell the story from a matchmaker's point of view in this game.

          <h1 class="fw-light text-center text-black">What is the Story of The Western Chamber?</h1>
          <p class="lead text-black text-left" style="--bs-text-opacity: .6;"> The Western Chamber, written by Wang
            Shifu, tells the story of Cui Yingying, a young lady of the Sangguo, who,
            with the help of her maid, Hongniang, breaks through the shackles of the world and its elaborate rituals to
            become a woman of her own free will. In this story, the character of Hongniang often has to deal with people
            in various difficulties for the life of the young lady. The role of the Red Chamberlain in this story is
            huge,
            without the Red Chamberlain as the link between these two young people who dare not speak of their love and
            are bound by the rules of etiquette, this story is unlikely to come to a happy ending. Every difficulty they
            go through is like a copy of the game, with the Red Chamberlain acting as the intruder in the copy. This was
            the main inspiration for the project design.

          <p class="lead text-black text-left" style="--bs-text-opacity: .6;"> The game is based on one of the versions
            of The Western Chamber performed by the Zhejiang Xiao Baihua Yue
            Opera Troupe. Therefore, the character designs are mainly based on the designs of this troupe, with some
            relative simplification due to the numerous and complex details and patterns of the costumes.

            For some parts that cannot be expressed through textual lines, audio of opera singing is used with
            associated
            animation to transition. For general character dialogue, simple click sounds are triggered when sentences
            are
            displayed to try to represent the drumbeat of the narration in the opera.

            Since this is my first-year project, the production process and results are relatively simple. I had some
            problems managing and assigning tasks, focusing too much on plot design and neglecting the time required to
            draw images, resulting in very intense and heavy work in the later stages. This is my first time using
            procreate electronic drawing software, so I am not familiar with its usage. In addition, this project also
            includes some virtual novel special software learning and use, although the process is a little difficult,
            but the final result is still more satisfactory.
          </p>

          <p class="lead text-black text-left" style="--bs-text-opacity: .6;">
            Compared to the previously identified non-functional requirements, the game's production style may not be
            particularly exciting for players. From a graphical and musical point of view, The West Wing will give
            players a gentler, slower, more laid-back feel than the excitement and tension it was intended to give
            players in the first place. What's more, user requirements need to be supported by more background research,
            but this is not well considered in the first year of production.

          </p>
          <p class="lead text-black text-left" style="--bs-text-opacity: .6;">
            Unfortunately, the game was not complete, and due to time constraints, I could only make a few snippets,
            such as some dialogue clips and some scenes and animations. It will take me more time to finish it. But I
            did my best to make a demo of some of the game's main features to simulate the intended effects of the game.
            In the future, I hope to learn from this and manage and organize my time better. I also wish I could express
            my ideas in a better way. If possible, I want to improve and improve the game and have a chance to finish
            it.
