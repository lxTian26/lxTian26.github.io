                </figure>
                <p>In my <r>Personal</r> understanding of this short film, the fox scholar 
                    and those beloved are all can be described as <r class="no-red">desires</r>. Desire generates desire, 
                    and the desire that is created generates more desire <r class="no-red">endlessly</r>. 
                    The fox scholar eats the pedilar's geese, just as desire devours the <r class="no-red">original intentions</r>.</p>
                    <figure class="lose">
                        <img src="images/image1&6/lose.png" alt="Pedilar get losed in this mountain" width="380">
                        <figcaption>Get losed in the mountain</figcaption>
                    </figure> 
                    <p>The <r class="no-red">pedilar</r>, like everyone who is deep in desire, loses himself in Goose Mountain.
                    And desire, in its constant development, returns once again to the original intention - 
                    the <r class="no-red">goose</r>. At the moment when the pedilar was determined to take the goose 
                    demon away, that is, to return to the past, the desires began to go back one 
                    by one and to be gathered up. In the end the fox scholar and the pedilar 
                    farewell, as if the <r class="no-red">mediocrity</r> and the <r class="no-red">flourishing</r> desires were saying goodbye. 
                    The fox scholar disappears and the pedilar returns to the identity of delivery 
                    and as well as to himself.</p> 
                    <h5 id="quoting">- Quoting relevant Literature for Better Interpretation -</h5>
                    <p>According to the <a href="https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hans/%E4%BD%9B%E8%AA%AA%E5%A6%99%E8%89%B2%E7%8E%8B%E5%9B%A0%E7%B7%A3%E7%B6%93">
                        <b><i>妙色王求法偈</i></b>(Chinese Buddhist Scriptures)</a>, <r class="no-red">"from love comes sorrow, 
                        from love comes terror, but if one is separated from love, there is 
                        neither sorrow nor terror"</r>. Love in this context can be understood as the 
                        love that the demon in the mountain has for their beloved, or it can 
                        be understood as desire and the pursuit of desire. With a clear mind, 
                        all things will therefore be resolved.</p>
