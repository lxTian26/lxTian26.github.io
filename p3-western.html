          An interactive storytelling game design based on the classic Chinese opera play The Western Chamber. By taking on the
          role of the Hong Niang, the player helps the couple, the scholar Zhang Sheng and the daughter of a nobleman,
          Cui Yingying, get through the obstacles and successfully settle their marriage.

        <h1 class="fw-light text-center text-white">Why this?</h1>
        <p class="lead text-black text-left" style="--bs-text-opacity: .6;">
          The original intention of doing this project was to make traditional Chinese arts more accessible to young
          people. For me, what attracted me most to opera was their stories and tunes. But many of my friends around me
          think opera is only for older people or find it boring, they can&#39t understand or feel the appeal of opera.
          Hence, I wanted to bring the voices that I find most enjoyable and appealing to a wider audience, and perhaps
          make more people understand the appeal of opera and reshape their understanding of it. </p>
          <p class="lead text-black text-left" style="--bs-text-opacity: .6;">            In addition, The Western Chamber was chosen as the prototype for this project because of its unique style of
          storytelling. In my perception, a love story is often found in a tragic setting in a play. But The Western
          Chamber is unusual in that it has a theme of love and characters that can lead to tragedy with a happy ending.
          The character that makes it so successful is Cui Yingying&#39s maid, Hong Niang, who is always there to help Cui
          Yingying and Zhang Sheng throughout the story after seeing the madam&#39s immoral behaviour. That&#39s why I decided
          to tell the story from the perspective of Hong Niang in this game.</p>

        <h1 class="fw-light text-center text-light">What is the Story of The Western Chamber?</h1>
        <p class="lead text-black text-left" style="--bs-text-opacity: .6;">          The Western Chamber, written by Wang Shifu, tells the story of Cui Yingying, a young lady of the Sangguo, who,
          with the help of her maid, Hongniang, breaks through the shackles of the world and its elaborate rituals to
          become a woman of her own free will. In this story, the character of Hongniang often has to deal with people
          in various difficulties for the life of the young lady. The role of the Red Chamberlain in this story is huge,
          without the Red Chamberlain as the link between these two young people who dare not speak of their love and
          are bound by the rules of etiquette, this story is unlikely to come to a happy ending. Every difficulty they
          go through is like a copy of the game, with the Red Chamberlain acting as the intruder in the copy. This was
          the main inspiration for the project design.

        <p class="lead text-black text-left" style="--bs-text-opacity: .6;">            The graphics are mainly ink and wash style, with a dark green background adding a sense of lightness and
          elegance to the whole screen. More attention is paid to the use of colour in the drawing of the characters and
          to fitting the costumes on the theatre stages. </p>
          <p class="lead text-black text-left" style="--bs-text-opacity: .6;">            The game is based on one of the versions of The Western Chamber performed by the Zhejiang Xiao Baihua Yue
          Opera Troupe. Therefore, the character designs are mainly based on the designs of this troupe, with some
          relative simplification due to the numerous and complex details and patterns of the costumes.

          For some parts that cannot be expressed through textual lines, audio of opera singing is used with associated
          animation to transition. For general character dialogue, simple click sounds are triggered when sentences are
          displayed to try to represent the drumbeat of the narration in the opera.

        <h1 class="fw-light text-center text-light">Reflection</h1>
        <p class="lead text-black text-left" style="--bs-text-opacity: .6;">            As this was my first-year project, the
          production process and results were relatively
          simple. I had encountered some problems in managing and assigning tasks, overly focusing on the plot design
          and neglecting the time needed to draw the images, resulting in a very tight and heavy workload in the
          post-production. This is my first time to use procreate as an electronic drawing software, so I am not
          familiar with its use. In addition, this project also included the learning and use of some special software
          for virtual novels, although the process was a bit difficult, but the final result was quite satisfactory.</p>

          <p class="lead text-black text-left" style="--bs-text-opacity: .6;">            The style in which this game is being made
          may not be particularly exciting for
          players compared to the previously identified Non-functional requirements. The West Wing will tend to give the
          player a gentler, slower as well as more laid-back feel, both in terms of graphics and music, rather than the
          excitement and tension that it was intended to accomplish from the outset. More than that, user requirements
          need to be more supported by background research, but it wasn&#39t well thought out in the first year of
          production.

        </p>
        <p class="lead text-black text-left" style="--bs-text-opacity: .6;">            Unfortunately this game is not complete, due to time constraints I was only able to make a few clips such as
          some dialogue pieces and a few scenes and animations. It will take me more time to finish it. But I tried my
          best to make some demos of the main features of this game to simulate the desired effect of the game. In the
          future, I hope to learn from this lesson and better manage and organise my time. I also hope to be able to
          express my ideas in a better way. If possible, I would like to improve and enhance the game and have the
          opportunity to complete it.
